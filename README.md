# LowS
## Description
My first operating system.

"LowS" because it makes a pun with "Low" and "S" making you pronounce "OS".
## Programming
The kernel is in C and I made a function that prints a sentence.
I also made two asm codes, one which boots the OS and another which launches the kernel.
(We also have a third but this one isn't important).
## What it does
For now, you can print any C character chain with 16 possible foreground and background colors
